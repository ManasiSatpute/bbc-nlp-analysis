NLP preprocessing, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition on BBC news headlines using NLTK &amp; spaCy
#  BBC News NLP Analysis

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques on the **BBC News dataset** to explore text preprocessing, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).  
It uses **NLTK** and **spaCy** for preprocessing and linguistic analysis.  



##  Features
- Lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal  
- Tokenization (raw + cleaned tokens)  
- Lemmatization using `WordNetLemmatizer`  
- Part-of-Speech tagging with spaCy  
- Frequency analysis of nouns, verbs, adjectives  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy  
- Aggregated counts of tokens and entities  



## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NLTK
- spaCy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
